# WebServerCent7Min
This is a <b>python</b> script that will install httpd along with some useful tools and open firewall ports 80 and 443

You can use this right after the first on a <b>CentOS 7 Minimal</b> Install as long as it is connected to the internet

After you run the <b>setup_*.py</b> script you should be able to browse to that machine's ip in a web browser on the same network and see the default apache website.
